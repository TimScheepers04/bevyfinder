# üß† Enhanced Night Tracker - AI-Powered Intoxication Tracking

## Overview

The Enhanced Night Tracker now includes **AI-powered intoxication tracking** using personal biometric data (age, weight, height, gender) to provide **accurate Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) calculations** and personalized sobriety assessments.

## üÜï New Features

### 1. Personal Details Collection
- **Age**: Required for metabolism rate calculations
- **Weight (kg)**: Used in Widmark formula for BAC calculation
- **Height (cm)**: Used for BMI calculations affecting alcohol distribution
- **Gender**: Affects metabolism and distribution factors

### 2. AI-Powered BAC Calculation
- **Widmark Formula**: Scientific standard for BAC calculation
- **Enhanced Factors**: Age, gender, BMI, and individual metabolism rates
- **Real-time Updates**: BAC updates as you drink and time passes
- **Metabolism Tracking**: Accounts for alcohol breakdown over time

### 3. Personalized Intoxication Assessment
- **Individual Factors**: Considers your specific body composition
- **Age Adjustments**: Different metabolism rates for different age groups
- **Gender-Specific**: Different distribution factors for males/females
- **BMI Considerations**: Body composition affects alcohol distribution

## üî¨ How the AI System Works

### BAC Calculation Algorithm

```javascript
// Widmark Formula with AI Enhancements
BAC = (Alcohol Grams / (r √ó Weight Grams)) √ó 100 - (Metabolism Rate √ó Hours)

Where:
- r = Widmark factor (varies by gender, age, BMI)
- Metabolism Rate = Individual rate based on age, gender, weight
- Hours = Time elapsed since first drink
```

### Key AI Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Widmark Factor (r)**
   - Base: Male = 0.68, Female = 0.55
   - Age adjustments: Younger people metabolize faster
   - BMI adjustments: Body composition affects distribution

2. **Personalized Metabolism Rate**
   - Age-based adjustments
   - Gender-specific rates
   - Weight considerations
   - Individual variations

3. **Real-time Updates**
   - Continuous BAC calculation
   - Time-based metabolism
   - Session persistence

## üìä BAC Levels and Status

| BAC Range | Status | Description | Color |
|-----------|--------|-------------|-------|
| 0.000% | Sober | No alcohol detected | Green |
| 0.001-0.019% | Sober | Minimal alcohol - safe to drive | Green |
| 0.020-0.039% | Buzzed | Light effects - stay hydrated | Orange |
| 0.040-0.079% | Impaired | Significant impairment - do not drive | Red |
| 0.080-0.149% | Drunk | High impairment - seek safe transport | Red |
| 0.150-0.249% | Very Drunk | Severe impairment - medical attention | Red |
| 0.250%+ | Dangerous | Life-threatening levels | Red |
