# üç∫ Realistic BAC Calculations - Night Tracker Update

## Overview

The Night Tracker BAC (Blood Alcohol Content) calculations have been updated to be more realistic and accurate to real-world drinking scenarios. The previous calculations were too aggressive and would show "life-threatening" levels after just a few drinks.

## üîß What Was Fixed

### **1. Standard Drink Conversion**
- **Before**: `totalAlcohol * 10` (incorrect conversion)
- **After**: `totalAlcohol * 14` (correct - 1 standard drink = 14g pure alcohol)

### **2. Widmark Factor Adjustments**
- **Before**: Aggressive age and BMI adjustments (up to 10% changes)
- **After**: Minimal realistic adjustments (1-2% changes)

### **3. Metabolism Rate**
- **Before**: Aggressive age and weight adjustments (up to 10% changes)
- **After**: Minimal realistic adjustments (1-2% changes)

### **4. Intoxication Assessment**
- **Before**: Jumped to "life-threatening" too quickly
- **After**: More realistic progression through intoxication levels

## üìä Realistic BAC Examples

### **Typical Scenarios**

| Drinks | Time | BAC (Male, 70kg) | Status |
|--------|------|------------------|--------|
| 1 drink | 1 hour | ~0.02% | Sober |
| 2 drinks | 1 hour | ~0.04% | Buzzed |
| 3 drinks | 1 hour | ~0.06% | Legally Impaired |
| 4 drinks | 1 hour | ~0.08% | Drunk |
| 5 drinks | 1 hour | ~0.10% | Very Drunk |
| 6 drinks | 1 hour | ~0.12% | Very Drunk |
| 8 drinks | 1 hour | ~0.16% | Heavily Intoxicated |
| 10+ drinks | 1 hour | ~0.20%+ | Severely Intoxicated |

### **Real-World BAC Levels**

| BAC Level | Real-World Effects | Legal Status |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| 0.000-0.019% | Minimal effects | Legal to drive |
| 0.020-0.049% | Relaxed, talkative | Legal to drive |
| 0.050-0.079% | Impaired judgment | Legal to drive (some states) |
| 0.080%+ | Legally impaired | Illegal to drive |
| 0.150%+ | Severe impairment | Medical attention advised |
| 0.250%+ | Life-threatening | Emergency medical care |

## üéØ New Assessment Levels

### **Realistic Progression**
1. **Sober** (0.000-0.019%): Safe to drive
2. **Slightly Buzzed** (0.020-0.029%): Mild euphoria
3. **Buzzed** (0.030-0.049%): Relaxed, talkative
4. **Legally Impaired** (0.050-0.079%): Illegal to drive
5. **Drunk** (0.080-0.099%): Clear impairment
6. **Very Drunk** (0.100-0.149%): Severe impairment
7. **Heavily Intoxicated** (0.150-0.199%): Medical attention advised
8. **Severely Intoxicated** (0.200-0.249%): Emergency care needed
9. **Dangerously Intoxicated** (0.250-0.349%): Life-threatening
10. **Life-Threatening** (0.350%+): Extreme danger

## üî¨ Scientific Basis

### **Widmark Formula**
```
BAC = (A / (r √ó W)) √ó 100 - (Œ≤ √ó t)
```
Where:
- **A** = Alcohol consumed in grams
- **r** = Widmark factor (0.68 for males, 0.55 for females)
- **W** = Body weight in grams
- **Œ≤** = Metabolism rate (0.015-0.017 per hour)
- **t** = Time since first drink in hours

### **Standard Drink Definition**
- **1 Standard Drink** = 14g pure alcohol
- **Examples**:
  - 12oz beer (5% ABV) = 1 standard drink
  - 5oz wine (12% ABV) = 1 standard drink
  - 1.5oz spirits (40% ABV) = 1 standard drink

## üé® Color-Coded Display

### **Visual Feedback System**
- **Green** (0.000-0.019%): Safe levels
- **Light Green** (0.020-0.049%): Caution levels
- **Orange** (0.050-0.079%): Warning levels
- **Red** (0.080-0.149%): Danger levels
- **Purple** (0.150-0.249%): Critical levels
- **Black** (0.250%+): Extreme danger

## üì± User Experience

### **Realistic Expectations**
- **3 drinks in 1 hour**: Shows as "Legally Impaired" (not life-threatening)
- **5 drinks in 1 hour**: Shows as "Very Drunk" (appropriate warning)
- **8+ drinks in 1 hour**: Shows as "Heavily Intoxicated" (medical attention)

### **Safety Warnings**
- **Legal Limits**: Clear indication when BAC reaches 0.08%
- **Medical Alerts**: Warnings for BAC levels requiring medical attention
- **Transportation Advice**: Recommendations for safe travel options

## üöÄ Benefits
