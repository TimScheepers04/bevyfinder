# 🚂 Railway Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Quick Deploy to Railway

Since Render is having persistent Status 127 errors, let's try Railway which is often more reliable for Node.js apps.

### **Step 1: Create Railway Account**
1. Go to: https://railway.app
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Create a new project

### **Step 2: Connect Repository**
1. Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
2. Select your `bevyfinder` repository
3. Railway will automatically detect it's a Node.js app

### **Step 3: Set Environment Variables**
In Railway dashboard, add these variables:
- `MONGODB_URI`: `mongodb+srv://TimScheepers:Mapimpi11@bevyfinder.fxww13z.mongodb.net/bevyfinder?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=BevyFinder`
- `JWT_SECRET`: `201ce5ec42a13b34b99ee6acc9a681aea47ace77aab8ada1e3337f152e1b813b`
- `JWT_EXPIRE`: `7d`
- `NODE_ENV`: `production`

### **Step 4: Deploy**
1. Railway will automatically deploy
2. Check the deployment logs
3. Get your API URL from the dashboard

### **Step 5: Test**
```bash
# Test the deployment
curl https://your-railway-url.railway.app/health
```

## 🆚 **Railway vs Render**

| Feature | Railway | Render |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Node.js Support | ✅ Excellent | ❌ Having issues |
| Free Tier | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Auto-deploy | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| Environment Variables | ✅ Easy | ✅ Easy |
| Logs | ✅ Clear | ✅ Clear |

## 🔧 **If Railway Works**

Once Railway deployment succeeds:
1. Update your frontend to use the Railway API URL
2. Test all functionality
3. Consider keeping Railway as your backend

## 📞 **Next Steps**

1. Try Railway deployment
2. If it works, we can abandon Render
3. If Railway also fails, we'll try other platforms

Railway is specifically designed for Node.js apps and usually works much better than Render for this type of deployment.
