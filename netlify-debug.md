# Netlify 404 Error Troubleshooting Guide

## Quick Fixes to Try

### 1. Force Redeploy
- Go to your Netlify dashboard
- Navigate to your site
- Click "Deploy" → "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"
- This will force a fresh deployment

### 2. Check Build Settings
In your Netlify dashboard:
- Go to Site settings → Build & deploy
- Verify these settings:
  - **Build command**: `echo 'Static site - no build required'` (or leave empty)
  - **Publish directory**: `.` (dot for root directory)
  - **Node version**: 18 (or latest LTS)

### 3. Check File Structure
Ensure these files are in your root directory:
- ✅ `index.html`
- ✅ `script.js`
- ✅ `styles.css`
- ✅ `netlify.toml`
- ✅ `_redirects` (newly added)

### 4. Test Locally First
```bash
# Install a simple HTTP server
npm install -g http-server

# Serve your site locally
http-server -p 3000

# Visit http://localhost:3000
```

### 5. Check Netlify Logs
- Go to your Netlify dashboard
- Click on the latest deployment
- Check the "Deploy log" for any errors
- Look for any build failures or missing files

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Page not found" on all routes
**Solution**: The `_redirects` file should fix this. If not:
1. Clear your browser cache
2. Try accessing the site in incognito mode
3. Check if the `_redirects` file was deployed

### Issue: Assets not loading (CSS/JS)
**Solution**: 
1. Check that `styles.css` and `script.js` are in the root directory
2. Verify file paths in `index.html` are correct
3. Check browser console for 404 errors on assets

### Issue: Build failing
**Solution**:
1. Remove any build command if you don't need one
2. Set publish directory to `.` (root)
3. Check that all required files are committed to Git

### Issue: Custom domain not working
**Solution**:
1. Verify DNS settings
2. Check domain configuration in Netlify
3. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours)

## Alternative Deployment Methods

If Netlify continues to have issues, try:

### GitHub Pages
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix deployment issues"
git push origin main
```
Then enable GitHub Pages in repository settings.

### Vercel
```bash
npm install -g vercel
vercel
```

### Firebase Hosting
```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase init hosting
firebase deploy
```

## Debugging Steps

1. **Check the exact URL** that's giving you the 404
2. **Verify the deployment** in Netlify dashboard
3. **Test with a simple HTML file** first
4. **Check browser console** for any JavaScript errors
5. **Verify all files are uploaded** to Netlify

## Contact Netlify Support

If none of the above works:
1. Go to Netlify support
2. Include your site URL
3. Share your `netlify.toml` configuration
4. Provide deployment logs
5. Mention you've tried the troubleshooting steps above
