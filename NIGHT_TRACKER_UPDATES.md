# üç∫ Night Tracker Updates - Protein to Calories & Realistic Intoxication Assessment

## Overview

The Night Tracker has been updated to replace protein tracking with calories and implement a more realistic intoxication assessment system based on scientific BAC (Blood Alcohol Content) levels.

## üîÑ Changes Made

### 1. Nutrition Tracking Update

#### **Replaced Protein with Calories**
- **Removed**: Protein tracking from all nutrition calculations
- **Added**: Detailed calories display in nutrition breakdown section
- **Updated**: All tracking functions to focus on calories instead of protein

#### **Updated Components**
- **HTML**: Changed nutrition breakdown display from "Protein" to "Calories"
- **JavaScript**: Removed all `totalProtein` references and calculations
- **Session Management**: Updated session initialization and reset functions
- **Drink Addition/Removal**: Modified to track calories instead of protein

### 2. Realistic Intoxication Assessment

#### **Scientific BAC Levels**
The intoxication assessment now uses scientifically accurate BAC thresholds:

| BAC Level | Status | Effects | Color |
|-----------|--------|---------|-------|
| 0.000% | Sober | No alcohol detected | Green |
| 0.001-0.019% | Sober | Minimal effects - safe to drive | Green |
| 0.020-0.029% | Slightly Buzzed | Mild euphoria - judgment slightly impaired | Light Green |
| 0.030-0.049% | Buzzed | Relaxed, talkative - coordination slightly affected | Light Green |
| 0.050-0.079% | Legally Impaired | Illegal to drive - judgment and coordination impaired | Orange |
| 0.080-0.099% | Drunk | Clear impairment - do not drive, seek safe transport | Red |
| 0.100-0.149% | Very Drunk | Severe impairment - slurred speech, poor coordination | Red |
| 0.150-0.199% | Heavily Intoxicated | Confusion, disorientation - medical attention advised | Purple |
| 0.200-0.299% | Severely Intoxicated | Stupor, unconsciousness possible - seek medical help | Purple |
| 0.300%+ | Life-Threatening | Coma, death possible - call emergency services immediately | Purple |

#### **Enhanced Warnings**
- **Legal Warnings**: Clear indication when BAC reaches illegal driving levels (0.08%+)
- **Health Warnings**: Medical attention alerts for high BAC levels (0.15%+)
- **Age Restrictions**: Special warnings for underage users
- **Transportation Advice**: Recommendations for safe transportation options

#### **Color-Coded BAC Display**
- **Green**: Safe levels (0.000-0.019%)
- **Light Green**: Caution levels (0.020-0.049%)
- **Orange**: Warning levels (0.050-0.079%)
- **Red**: Danger levels (0.080-0.149%)
- **Purple**: Critical levels (0.150%+)

## üîß Technical Implementation

### **Frontend Updates**

#### **HTML Changes**
```html
<!-- Before -->
<span class="nutrition-label">Protein:</span>
<span class="nutrition-value" id="total-protein">0g</span>

<!-- After -->
<span class="nutrition-label">Calories:</span>
<span class="nutrition-value" id="total-calories-detailed">0</span>
```

#### **JavaScript Updates**
```javascript
// Removed protein tracking
// Before: totalProtein: 0,
// After: (removed)

// Updated display function
const totalCaloriesDetailed = document.getElementById('total-calories-detailed');
if (totalCaloriesDetailed) {
    totalCaloriesDetailed.textContent = Math.round(currentSession.totalCalories);
}
```

#### **Intoxication Assessment**
```javascript
function assessIntoxication(bac, user) {
    // Realistic BAC thresholds with scientific accuracy
    if (bac < 0.02) {
        status = 'Sober';
        details = 'Minimal effects - safe to drive';
    } else if (bac < 0.03) {
        status = 'Slightly Buzzed';
        details = 'Mild euphoria - judgment may be slightly impaired';
    }
    // ... additional realistic levels
}
```

### **Data Structure Changes**
- **Session Object**: Removed `totalProtein` property
- **Drink Entries**: Removed `protein` field from drink tracking
- **Display Elements**: Updated to show calories instead of protein
